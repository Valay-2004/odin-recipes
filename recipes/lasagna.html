        Here's a more detailed look: <br>
        History:
        Lasagna's origins are traced back to the 14th century, with variations evolving before being codified in its
        classic Bolognese form. <br>
        Ingredients:
        The dish features thin layers of pasta dough made from flour, egg, and sometimes spinach. Fillings can include
        ragù (meat sauce), béchamel, vegetables, and various cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan.
        <br>
        Variations:
        Lasagna comes in many regional and personal variations, including vegetarian versions with vegetables and cream
        sauces, and meat-based versions with traditional sauces and cheeses.
        <br>
        Making Lasagna:
        Lasagna is made by layering lasagna noodles, fillings, and sauces, then baking until the cheese melts and
        bubbles.
        <br>
        Serving:
        After baking, the lasagna is typically cut into single-serving portions.
