        <h1>Lasagna</h1>
        <h2 class="section-title">Description</h2>
        <p><b>Lasagna is a popular Italian dish consisting of layered pasta sheets, various fillings like ragù (meat
                sauce)
                or
                béchamel (white sauce), and cheeses. It's a baked pasta dish, often served in rectangular portions.
            </b><br>
            Here's a more detailed look: <br>
            <b>History:</b>
            Lasagna's origins are traced back to the 14th century, with variations evolving before being codified in its
            classic Bolognese form. <br>
            <!-- <b>Ingredients:</b>
        The dish features thin layers of pasta dough made from flour, egg, and sometimes spinach. Fillings can include
        ragù (meat sauce), béchamel, vegetables, and various cheeses like ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan.
        <br> -->
            <b>Variations:</b>
            Lasagna comes in many regional and personal variations, including vegetarian versions with vegetables and
            cream
            sauces, and meat-based versions with traditional sauces and cheeses.
            <br>
            <b>Making Lasagna:</b>
            Lasagna is made by layering lasagna noodles, fillings, and sauces, then baking until the cheese melts and
            bubbles.
            <br>
            <b>Serving:</b>
            After baking, the lasagna is typically cut into single-serving portions.

                    <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>

                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Put pasta water on to boil:</h4>
                        <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the
                            stovetop on
                            high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your
                            pasta
                            water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Brown the ground beef:</h4>
                        <p>In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef
                            and cook until
                            it is lightly browned on all sides. <br>
                            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</h4>
                        <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo, we are using yellow bell
                            pepper and
                            red onions). <br>
                            Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the
                            minced
                            garlic and cook half a minute more. <br>
                            Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and cook
                            for another
                            5 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Make the sauce:</h4>
                        <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes,
                            tomato sauce,
                            and tomato paste to the pot. <br>
                            Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle
                            with garlic
                            powder and/or garlic salt, to taste. <br>
                            Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting
                            after each
                            addition. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic your tomatoes are.)
                            <br>
                            Add salt to taste. Remember that you will later be adding parmesan, which is salty.
                            <br>
                            Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to
                            45 minutes,
                            stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot occasionally, making sure nothing sticks to the
                            bottom and
                            scorches.
                            <br>
                            Remove from heat.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles:</h4>
                        <p>By now, the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry
                            lasagna noodles
                            and
                            cook them to al dente, per package directions. (Note: noodles may be cooked in advance.)
                            <br>
                            Stir the water often to prevent sticking. Make sure that the water remains at a full rolling
                            boil during
                            the
                            entire cooking process, in order to prevent noodles from sticking.
                            <br>
                            When the noodles are done, drain them in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently
                            separating any
                            noodles
                            that may be sticking together.
                            <br>
                            Spread a little olive oil on a large, rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles on
                            this sheet,
                            turning them once so that all sides get coated with some of the olive oil. This will prevent
                            them from
                            sticking together.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Assemble the lasagna:</h4>
                        <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce over the bottom of the dish
                            and spread it
                            evenly. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise over the sauce (about 3 long
                            noodles; the edges
                            may overlap, depending on your pan). Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.
                            <br>
                            Sprinkle a third of the grated mozzarella on top of the lasagna sauce. Add half of the
                            ricotta cheese by
                            placing cheese dollops every two inches. Sprinkle half of the grated parmesan cheese evenly
                            over the top
                            of the ricotta cheese.
                            <br>
                            Apply the second layer of noodles. Top it with half of the remaining sauce. Add half of the
                            remaining
                            mozzarella, the rest of the ricotta cheese, and the rest of the parmesan cheese.
                            <br>
                            Finish with a final layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce over the top layer of
                            noodles and
                            sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Bake:</h4>
                        <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tenting the foil slightly so it doesn't touch the
                            noodles or
                            sauce. Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. If you'd like more of a crusty top or edges, uncover
                            the lasagna in
                            the last 10 minutes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cool and serve:</h4>
                        <p>Allow the lasagna to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep for
                            about 5 days.
                            You can reheat lasagna in a conventional oven or microwave. While storing, leave the
                            aluminum tent on.
                            (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</p>
