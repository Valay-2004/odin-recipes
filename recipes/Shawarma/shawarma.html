    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken shawarma is a Middle Eastern dish where marinated chicken is slow-roasted on a vertical spit, then thinly
        sliced and served, often in a pita or wrap. It's a popular street food with a history rooted in the Ottoman
        Empire, where it was traditionally made with lamb but can also be made with chicken, turkey, beef, or falafel.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <strong>MARINADE</strong>
        <li>2 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>a pinch cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ - ½ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <br>
        <strong>Other Ingredients</strong>
        <li>2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast cutlets, ( ½” thick)</li>
        <li>1 medium red onion, peeled and cut into eight wedges</li>
        <li>¾ cup plain fat free Greek yogurt, (I use Fage 0%)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light mayonnaise, (I use Hellmanns)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tahini, stirred</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>8 pitas</li>
        <li>8 leaves green leaf lettuce</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ medium cucumber, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps/Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place all the marinade ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk together until combined. Place the chicken
            breast cutlets in a zip-top bag and pour the marinade over top of the chicken. Seal the bag and toss/massage
            the contents until the chicken coated in the marinade. Place the bag in the refrigerator and allow to
            marinate for at least 2 hours, up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, heat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking sheet with foil or parchment
            paper. Lift each chicken cutlet out of the marinade letting the excess drop off before transferring it to
            the baking sheet. When the chicken is removed, place the onion wedges into the marinade and toss to coat.
            Transfer the onion pieces to the baking sheet as well, spreading it out alongside the chicken.</li>
        <li>When the oven is heated, place the baking sheet inside and roast for 16-22 minutes until the chicken cutlets
            are cooked through. Turn the oven to broil and stick the sheet under the broiler for an additional minute or
            two to brown everything up and finish off the onions. Allow the chicken to rest for 10 minutes before
            slicing to allow it to retain its juices. When rested, cut into thin slices.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, stir together the Greek yogurt, mayonnaise, lemon juice, stirred tahini, and garlic
            powder until well combined.</li>
        <li>To build each wrap, lay a pita on a clean dry surface and top with 1 large lettuce leaf and then 1-2 tomato
            slices, stacked in a line down the center of the wrap. On top of the tomatoes put a row of cucumbers
            followed by about 1/8th of the roasted onions. Follow with 2.875 ounces of the sliced chicken and then top
            with two tablespoons of the white sauce. Sprinkle with parsley and serve! Repeat with remaining ingredients
            to form 8 wraps.</li>
    </ol>
